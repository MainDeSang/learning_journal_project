# Learning Journal Project

Welcome to the Learning Journal Project! This project is designed to document and share my progress through the Scrimba Frontend Career Path, showcasing skills in HTML, CSS, and responsive web design.

## Overview

The Learning Journal is a personal blog that captures various stages, challenges, and milestones in my journey to becoming a frontend developer. It consists of three main sections:

- **Home Page (index.html)**: A collection of blog-style entries on various learning experiences.
- **Post Page (post.html)**: Dedicated pages for individual blog posts with detailed reflections on specific topics.
- **About Me Page (about.html)**: An introduction to my background, learning goals, and motivations.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Ensures optimal viewing experience across devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
- **Structured Layout**: Clean and minimalistic design for readability and focus on content.
- **Modular CSS**: Separate CSS files for each page to maintain organized and maintainable styling.

## Learning Objectives

This project aims to achieve the following educational goals:

1. **Responsive Web Design**: Apply principles of responsive design to create layouts that adapt to various screen sizes using relative units, media queries, flexbox, and grid.
2. **Semantic HTML**: Utilize semantic HTML5 elements to enhance the structure and accessibility of the web pages.
3. **CSS Flexbox and Grid**: Implement CSS flexbox and grid layouts to create flexible and efficient page structures.
4. **Version Control**: Use Git for version control to manage and track changes throughout the development process.
5. **Project Planning**: Develop project planning skills by consulting design files, drafting documentation, and organizing development tasks.
